# Simple-Tensorflow-JS-Image-Classifier
#### Here we build a custom image classifier that you will train on the fly in the browser using TensorFlow.js.

### Train & Predict

First, connect to the site and then grant WebCam privileges. 

Take a object or something that corresponds to each class of four (A to D) and press the Train X button.

Now you can see Prediction and Probability at the bottom.

If the Prediction is not correct or the Probability is low, add more training data.
